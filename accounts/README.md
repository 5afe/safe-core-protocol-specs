# Accounts

The Safe protocol aims to be **account agnostic** in the long run. At the very beginning it will be necessary to set a focus on specific account standards to speed up the development. Therefore the initial focus will be on the [1.x versions of the Safe accounts](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts). Once an initial version of the protocol is in place the learnings can be used to create a more optimized version of the Safe that can be integrated with the protocol (aka Safe 2.0). With this it should be also possible to collect enough insights to open up the protocol for any account standard that wants to utilize the benefits introduced by the Safe protocol, making it a global public good.
