# Objective

The objective of the protocol is to **enforce** the **correct conduct and procedures** of a system of rules of the **Safe ecosystem**


- What is the `correct conduct and procedures`
    - **Compatibility**
        - Following specific contract interfaces
        - Best practices for development
            - Tests
- What is `enforcement`?
    - **Incentives** and **Penalties**
        - Staking for responsibility
            - Enforce on-chain
        - Take responsibility
            - Pay for incorrectness
    - Examples
        - App store (listing requirements)
        - Https
- What is the `Safe Ecosystem`?
    - Contracts: Modules, Guards, Handlers
    - Infrastructure: Indexers, Relayers, …
    - Interfaces: Web Interfaces, Safe Apps, …


This initial version of the Safe protocol has a strong focus on the `Contracts` part of the `Safe Ecosystem`, as the smart contracts have a major impact and are at the core of the Safe product.

In the long run the protocol should also cover the other parts of the `Safe Ecosystem` such as `Infrastructure` and `Interfaces`. This would included areas such as "What are the canonical Safe accounts?", "What indexers provide Safe related information?", "What interfaces support the Safe (Protocol)?". The protocol should enforce guidelines for these areas and make sure that they can be applied cross-network. This way it will become the basis for a multi-chain smart contract account ecosystem.
